# Gravitas

Gravitas is a real-time 3D gravitational simulation that visualizes celestial motion and mass-based spacetime distortion. Designed with C++, OpenGL, and ImGui, the project offers an interactive environment to explore the effects of gravity between planetary bodies.

## Important Note
This project is inspired by kavan010's Gravity_Sim project, and part of my code is his code, so please, credit kavan010 for the idea, like I am doing and will do!

## Secondary Note
The libs are already in the repo, but just don't forget to link them with my provided CMakeLists.txt!  

## 🌠 Features

- 🪐 **Realistic gravity-based motion** between celestial objects.
- 🔦 **Dynamic lighting** with Phong shading.
- ✨ **Glow effect** for stars (e.g., the Sun).
- 🧠 **ImGui interface** for:
  - Camera controls
  - Pausing/resuming simulation
  - Live object data monitoring
- 🌌 **Spacetime distortion grid** updated using relativistic principles.
